			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				"I'm international student from Aalto university Finland doing my spring semester here! I moved to New York (Brooklyn) two weeks ago. At first I had a small culture shock but I have used to local rythm of life quite fast and well. Back in Finland my majors (I study both business and engineering) are information networks (communications, math, programming industrial engineering and work psychology) and economics. I am 3rd year student and will (hopefully) have my bachelor's degree after this semester. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My passion is to work between human and technology helping people use and get advance of it. Currently I'm working in car rental industry as digital advisor: helping marketing, sales and operations departments with digital stuff, excel macros etc. Besides working I have also been active in student organizations and events, such as in world leading startup event Slush."

			<h2>My experiment</h2>
			<p>
				"My web development experience is quite limited, I have done one course in Finland two years ago, so the basics of html, css and jQuery hopefully  returns to my head fast. My work experience include some web development related stuff, but more information maintaining than coding. I know principles of Github but didn't have own account before. I'm taking the course simply because I want to have more skills and experinece in web development to be able to understund and use html-based tools better."
